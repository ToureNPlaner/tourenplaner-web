ToureNPlaner Javascript Client
==============================

Installation:
-------------

The webclient can be used without any installation or you can build a 
compressed version which increases the loading time and (potentially) 
the performance.
To build a compressed version ``ant`` is required. Go into the build/ 
folder and use ``ant build`` for a compressed version, ``ant minify`` 
for an also minified version.
See build/config/project.properties for more customizations.
